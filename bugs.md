# Santa Tracker Bugs

## All Games
1. **Video Playback Ending**: Video triggers a "Game over" immediately when it finishes, instead of waiting for proper conditions.
2. **Lack of Win/Loss Notification**: The game ends without showing whether the player won or lost, leaving the outcome unclear.
3. **Special End-of-Game Sign in Games Like Present Drop**: Games with no clear win/loss need unique signs to acknowledge player performance (e.g., "Great Job!" or "Better Luck Next Time").

## Snowball Storm
1. **Pre-hit Freeze**: The character freezes in place when someone attempts to shoot, causing the player to become immobile before actually being hit.
2. **Unfair Elf Placements**:
   - Some elves spawn on isolated ice chunks that do not connect to the main landmass, leaving them trapped.
   - Certain elves are placed in small, enclosed spaces surrounded by trees or snow piles, with no viable escape routes.
   - Gifts often spawn in the same spots as elves, causing confusion and competition for both.
   - Some map areas are overly crowded with elves, leading to chaotic situations where players are immediately shot at without a chance to defend or strategize.
## Santa Search
1.After playing Santa Search once, the game ends with a "Game over" message. However, when the player presses the "Re-play the game" button under the elf, the game immediately ends again with another "Game over" message, even though the player is attempting to replay.
